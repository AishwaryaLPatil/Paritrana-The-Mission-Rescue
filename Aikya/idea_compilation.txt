Project Title: Paritrāṇa - Mission Rescue
Project Description:
Creating a website for the whole rescue process of pets, Dogs in particular. We as a team envision to prototype(Model) a drone which will track the presence of the Dog and plans the best path to be followed by the rescuer. 
Once the pet is found, the first aid instruction are provided by the website with the help of a chatbot(using Machine Learning model).
It is then taken to rescue centre using google map api to find the nearest veternery clinic.
Scheduling the vaccination and further treatement is done by providing Desktop notifiers.
Now that the dog is completely cured, adaption facilities are made available.Therefore, a complete rescue process is made easy through a small intervention of Tech. 
This is a brief description of the project "Paritrāṇa- Mission Rescue"

Problem statement:
A major problem faced by the abandoned, stray dogs in a country such as India, is that they are mistreated due to which they lack the love that they deserve.
Pets usually are emotionally attached to their owners. But they are sometimes abandoned either due to financial crisis of the owners or the dog is suffering with a disease.
There are many rescue centers built which takes lot of time and resource to protect a single Dog. To make it more efficient and less time consuming, there should be an intervention of Technology
So there is an urgent need for the rescue system to be built as a whole which provides all the neccessary requirements for the rescue so that the time is saved and many projects of rescue can be taken up
